    "The graph shows a strong dependence of the viscosity on the degree of cure. As the degree of cure approaches the gel point (0.64), the viscosity goes to infinity. Once the resin reaches a viscosity of around 0.4 Pas, it's no longer flowable. In a properly designed process, the resin must fully impregnate the reinforcement before reaching this limiting viscosity. At a higher temperature, the viscosity is lower for the same degree of cure, however the resin also cures faster. A balance can be struck between viscosity and cure speed in order to ensure full impregnation of the reinforcement."

    "Answer:\n",
    "1. The initial lowering is due to the increase in temperature of the resin. As temperature increases, viscosity decreases. This is seen in all (conventional) liquids, and is also true for resin systems. The internal kinetic energy of the molecules increases with temperature, causing them to move more freely and reducing the internal friction between layers of the fluid, which results in a lower viscosity.\n",
    "2. As the temperature increases and time goes on, the resin system starts to cure increasingly fast. This causes the degree of cure to increase, and as seen in the previous question, this strongly increases the viscosity of the resin. As the degree of cure approaches the gel point, the viscosity goes to infinity. This as the polymer chains start to crosslink and form a network. Once this network is formed, the resin can no longer flow.\n",
    "3. The curves shown are of different mixed samples that are heated continuously. As they are being heated, they start to cure. The different heating rates cause the resins to be at different degrees of cure at the same temperature, as the slower heated sample has more time to cure, thus reaching gelation at a lower temperature. Thus the exponential rise in viscosity starts earlier for the slower heated samples."

    "- The storage modulus shows a significant drop at around 100 degrees celcius. Presumably, this is the glass transition temperature of the material. Below this temperature, the polymer chains are in a glassy state, being rigid and unable to move. Above this temperature, the polymer chains can move past each other, however they are still linked together by crosslinks. This results in a material state in between visco-elastic and visco-plastic.\n",
    "- At that same temperature, the loss modulus shows a peak. The viscous behavior can absorb the most energy around this temperature, due to the increased, but still somewhat limited mobility of the polymer chains. Below this temperature, the chains are too rigid to move and absorb much energy, and above this temperature, the chains move more freely, again limiting the energy absorption."

Now, assume a constant viscosity of 0.03 Pa.s and a distance of 1 meter for the resin to flow. Determine the required pressure to inject over this distance in 40 minutes, for different fibre volume fractions from 0.35 to 0.65 with steps of 0.05.

   "source": "Comment: The obtained results indicate that both permeability K and pressure difference ΔP strongly affect the infusion process; namely a higher K or ΔP reduce the infusion time as the flow rate increases directly with these parameters. From the plots it can be observed that the bigger the cavity the higher the permeability and the less pressure needed, which is indeed favorable, however it's penalized in the lower fibre volume fraction which results in a less reinforced composite. Thus, the calculated values should therefore be treated with a lot of caution, so it is essential to understand the future application of the composite in order to make informed and balanced decisions on the choice of K, ΔP and process tolerances to ensure an adequate impregnation and an acceptable final part quality."
